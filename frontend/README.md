# Frontend
This is built using Next.js, which renders React server side
- We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for autoformatting precommit hook and [standard](https://github.com/standard/standard) as our code style with eslint as the linter
- We use [Flow](https://flow.org) for type checking. Look [here](https://flow.org/en/docs/types/) for types

To start:
```
yarn
yarn dev
```
