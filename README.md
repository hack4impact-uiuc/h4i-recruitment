[Original Proposal](./proposal.md) by tko22

This application uses [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js), an incredible framework built on top of React that allows for server-side rendering, [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) for the backend API along with MongoDB as the choice of data persistence.

## Setup

Both the setup for the [frontend](https://github.com/hack4impact-uiuc/h4i-recruitment/blob/master/frontend/README.md) and [backend](https://github.com/hack4impact-uiuc/h4i-recruitment/blob/master/backend/README.md) are in the README of their respective folders.

## A Peek

A full fledged platform for managing candidates, their application, interviews, and notes that's catered towards our recruitment process.
